*** Proper Usage *** The information on government servers are in the public domain, unless specifically annotated otherwise, and may be used freely by the public.

This information shall not be modified in content and then presented as official government material.
This dataset was created to depict the boundaries of NMFS Regulated Areas in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Waters (Regulated Areas) only.  The dataset should not be used for a legal definition.  The dataset should not be used to infer information regarding the existence or details of other marine features or resources, including, but not limited to, navigable waters, coastlines, bathymetry, submerged features, or man-made structures.  Users assume responsibility for determining the appropriate use of this dataset.
*** Not the Legal Definition *** This Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset is not the legal definition of the Regulated Area. The description published in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations is the only legal definition.  This dataset and metadata document provide a broad overview of a subset of applicable fishing regulations, restrictions and requirements; it is not a substitute for the actual regulations. Users are encouraged to read the applicable regulations in conjunction with use of this dataset.  
*** Temporal Considerations *** Regulated Area boundary definitions are subject to change or modification.  Published datasets may represent historic, current, or future Regulated Areas.  When changes to fishing regulations affect this dataset, it will be archived and replaced by an updated version as soon as feasible.  Approved Regulated Area boundaries may also be published prior to their effective date.  It is the user’s responsibility to ensure the applicable Regulated Area boundaries are being used.  
*** Shorelines/Base Layers *** The accuracy of this dataset is dependent upon the accuracy and resolution of the datasets (e.g., shoreline, bathymetry, shared administrative boundaries) used in the creation process. Source datasets used are specified in the metadata.  These data sources were selected for their suitability to a broad audience, and may not be suitable for specific uses requiring higher-resolution information. 
Coastlines change.  Unless otherwise noted, where the NOAA Medium Resolution Shoreline is used, assume the regulatory boundary reaches the most current coastline delineation available.</useconst><descript><abstract>This dataset depicts the boundaries of the Herring Management Areas in ESRI shapefile format for the NOAA Fisheries Service’s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO).  This shapefile includes boundaries for the following Regulated Areas:
 - Management Area 1A (Inshore Gulf of Maine)
 - Management Area 1B (Offshore Gulf of Maine)
 - Management Area 2 (South Coastal Area)
 - Management Area 3 (Georges Bank)

Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these GIS files are considered to be approximate representations and are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact regulated area boundaries.  For information on the official legal definition refer to the Use Constraints metadata section.</abstract><purpose>Beginning in 2010 and in response to mounting requests for digital depictions of NMFS Regulated Areas in Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Waters (Regulated Areas), the NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Committee launched a project to standardize the development, publication and regular updating of GIS files depicting Regulated Area boundaries.  This dataset is a product of that initiative.

To standardize Regulated Area features sharing these boundaries, published shapefiles of the shared administrative boundaries were obtained from the authoritative agencies.  A shoreline was selected that was suitable for general mapping purposes, freely and publicly available, of medium-resolution, and covering the extent of the U.S..  When necessary, the boundaries were transformed to NAD83. A series of template polygon shapefiles were then generated, using these authoritative boundaries as the outward extents of the polygon.  All templates were generated in NAD83 geographic coordinate system.  The templates created are: 1) Coast-to-EEZ: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida (an arbitrary cut-off for the Atlantic); 2) Coast-to-SLA: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the Submerged Lands Act boundary, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida; 3) SLA-to-EEZ: bounded by the Submerged Lands Act boundary, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida.  These templates were subsequently copied and edited, as needed by the Regulated Area spatial definitions.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Get Definition Text] The current legal spatial definition for the Regulated Area was copied from the e-CFR website.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Features From Templates] To generate the Regulated Area boundary in ArcGIS, a copy of the Coast-to-EEZ template polygon was split by connecting coordinates in the order specified in the spatial definition.  When the spatial definition specified that points were connected following the Coastline or EEZ the coinciding outward extent of the template polygon was used.  After all points were appropriately connected, any portions of the template outside the Regulated Area were discarded.  When multiple Regulated Areas are a part of a larger grouping of related Regulated Areas, these steps were repeated to generate a unique feature for each Regulated Area and the features were then combined into a single shapefile.  When the spatial definition specified that points were connected following a straight line, rhumb lines were constructed by projecting the shapefile into a NAD83 Mercator projection, which maintains straight rhumbs.  The boundaries were densified with consecutive vertices interpolated no more than 10 nautical miles apart, to preserve rhumb line paths in other coordinate systems.  (Boundaries following the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary were unaffected because the source shapefile depicting this legally-defined geodesic line was densified with vertices placed &lt;1mi apart.) The file was then projected back to the un-projected NAD83 coordinate system.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Cape Cod Canal] NOTE: Due to the resolution of the source coastline shapefile, Cape Cod Canal fully connects Cape Cod Bay to Buzzards Bay in the template shapefile, rendering Cape Cod as an island.  Regulated Area definitions rarely specify a boundary across this canal, but one must be generated to fully "close off" a coastal polygon that is intended to be restricted to either side of Cape Cod.  As a result, Cape Cod Canal was split, arbitrarily, at 70°34’W longitude.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Add Attributes] The standardized attribute schema was applied to the shapefile, and the fields were defined.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Policy Review] The Regulated Area spatial definition text, shapefile geometry and attribute values were reviewed with policy staff to verify that the shapefile accurately depicted and described the intended boundaries.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2015</procdate><procdesc>[Check Geometry] The ESRI ArcGIS Check Geometry tool was run on the shapefile to identify any geometry problems.
